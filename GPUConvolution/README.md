Friday afternoon project to learn GPU-accelerated convolution performed with CUDA.

Project and provided code taken directly from CS 179 - GPU Programming at CalTech. See lab1.txt for details.

Really great learning experience and introduction from CalTech, next project will probably be based off of an Nvidia example...
